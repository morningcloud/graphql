= Distinct

Retrieving unique node properties can be achieved by setting the `distinct` option to `true` when querying for data.

Using the following example type definition:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    runtime: Int!
}
----

You would fetch the unique `runtime` from `Movie` nodes by executing:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies(options: {
        distinct: true
    }) {
        runtime
    }
}
----

The following queries would fetch the runtime value of all movies. If more than one movie have the same runtime duplicate values will be returned:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies {
        runtime
    }
}
----
----
query {
    movies(options: {
        distinct: false
    }) {
        runtime
    }
}
----

Additionally, say there was a relationship between the `Movie` and an `Actor` type, distinct option can also be applied when fetching the `actors` field:

[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
query {
    movies {
        title
        runtime
        actors(options: {
            distinct: true
        }) {
            surname
        }
    }
}
----
